### Code Overview

The model can be run inside [doublet_detection.ipynb](src/doublet_detection.ipynb). 

The model use BoostClassifier to fit the data. The `p_thresh` and `voter_thresh` can be adjusted to achieve different results for the prediction - i.e., to adjust the number of predicted doublet in the output.
